      "description": "My name is Ethan Luxton. I come from an educational background in marketing and public relations. I pivoted very heavily after college into finance. Specifically retail banking and wealth management. Throughout my entire life, I have always found technology interesting, I built my first computer when I was 13, and programmed my first ‘Hello world’ that same year. Since then, I programmed on and off throughout high school and college, in various languages: C#, Java, C++, HTML, and Python to name a few. Recently, I decided that I wasn’t fully committed to a career in finance, so I decided to make the switch to software development. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but I have learned so much in the past months to build upon my previous experience. To include various web development tools and languages. My current goal is to help build the technologies that the world uses every day, from the operating systems we use to the front end of a website that serves millions. The thing that excites me the most about tech, is the future. We are in an era where there are so many new technologies and developments, it is really exciting to see all these amazing things come to life and I can't wait to see what comes in the future.",
